# Individual Reflections Week 12 - Pawel

* What do I want to learn or understand better?

I do not have any experience with agile software development and I want to learn how the framework Scrum works in practice. I believe that this can be achieved by trying to adhere to the rules of Scrum throughout the software development process. Moreover, I want to learn more about web development, and more specifically about the frameworks/libraries that will be used in the project. I plan to do this by learning from relevant resources that can be found online.

* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I can possibly help someone else or the entire team, to learn something new by sharing my point of view and what I have learned or by sharing resources that I find useful.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

We have not started using Scrum yet, but our team has discussed various aspects of Scrum during meetings. To prepare myself I have read The 2020 Scrum Guide.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I participated in two meetings this week where we, among other things, decided on what should be included in the social contract.

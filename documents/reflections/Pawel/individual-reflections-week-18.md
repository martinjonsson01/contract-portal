# Individual Reflections Week 18 - Pawel

* What do I want to learn or understand better?

This week I learned about many-to-many relationships in Entity Framework Core and learned more about writing tests using XUnit. In the next sprint I want to learn how to setup a local database. I plan to do this by following tutorials and possibly asking team members for help.

* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I can possibly help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new by learning more about the technologies that are used in the project, sharing resources that I find useful, working together on user stories and participating in discussions.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I participated in the Sprint Planning, Sprint Retrospective and Sprint Review and wrote a few Daily Scrum messages throughout the week about what I have done and what I plan to do. Next week I plan to be more consistent in regard to writing Daily Scrum messages.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I worked on 87-show-personalized-favorites, but the user story was not finished during the sprint. To avoid situations like this in the upcoming sprints I will try to avoid underestimating the story points of user stories and plan asking other team members for help earlier when issues occur.

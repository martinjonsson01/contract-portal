# Individual Reflections Week 19 - Pawel

* What do I want to learn or understand better?

This week I learned how to set up a local database and how to set environmental variables. In the next sprint I want to learn more about CSS and Bootstrap. I plan to do this by working on relevant user stories and reading documentation.

* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I can possibly help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new by learning more about the technologies that are used in the project, sharing resources that I find useful, working together on user stories and participating in discussions.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I participated in the Sprint Planning, Sprint Retrospective and Sprint Review and wrote Daily Scrum messages throughout the week.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I finished 87-show-personalized-favorites together with Jacob.

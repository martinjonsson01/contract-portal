# Individual Reflections Week 17 - Pawel

* What do I want to learn or understand better?

I initially planned to learn more about how authentication and authorization works in Blazor this week but it turned out that this was not the focus of the user story I worked on. By working on 85-user-identification I instead learned how a modal window can be implemented and how JavaScript functions can be invoked from .NET. In the next sprint I want to learn about relational databases. I plan to do this by reading documentation and working on a relevant user story.

* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I can possibly help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new by learning more about the technologies that are used in the project, sharing resources that I find useful, working together on user stories and participating in discussions.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I participated in the Sprint Planning, Sprint Retrospective and Sprint Review and wrote messages throughout the week about what I have done and what I plan to do, which is our way of organizing Daily Scrums.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I worked on 85-user-identification and did a code review.

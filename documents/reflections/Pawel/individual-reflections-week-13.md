# Individual Reflections Week 13 - Pawel

* What do I want to learn or understand better?

This week I have read about the major differences between C# and Java and learned more about Blazor by following a tutorial and building a basic web application. I want to learn more about C# and understand how a Blazor project is structured. I plan to do this by starting to work on the project and reading documentation.

* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I can possibly help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new by learning more about the technologies that are going to be used in the project and participating in discussions.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Our team will begin using Scrum next week. This week I have learned more about Scrum by attending the lecture about the characteristics of a good user story and the importance of vertical user stories.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I participated in the meeting where we decided what should be included in the business model canvas, which is a part of the document Project Scope.

# Individual Reflections Week 20 - Pawel

* What do I want to learn or understand better?

As planned, I learned more about CSS and Bootstrap in this sprint. I did this by working on relevant user stories, reading documentation and inspecting elements on other websites. In the future I want to learn more about responsive web design.

* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I can possibly help someone else to learn something new by learning more about different technologies and ideas, sharing resources that I find useful, working together on user stories, doing code reviews, and participating in discussions. In the future I may be able to help someone else learn something new by sharing knowledge I have gained during this project.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I participated in the Sprint Planning, Sprint Retrospective and the final Sprint Review in which we showed the stakeholder what we have accomplished in this project. I also wrote Daily Scrum messages throughout the week.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I worked on 157-adding-footer, 151-login-loading-indicator and 177-topbar-remastered.

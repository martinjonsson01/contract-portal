# Individual Reflections Week 16 - Pawel

* What do I want to learn or understand better?

This week I got a better understanding of how the backend works, and how the frontend communicates with the backend, by working on two vertical user stories. In the next sprint I want to learn how authentication and authorization works in Blazor. I plan to do this by reading documentation and working on a relevant user story.

* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I can possibly help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new by learning more about the technologies that are used in the project, sharing resources that I find useful and participating in discussions.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

This week I was the Scrum Master in our team. By now, however, we have gotten used to the Scrum workflow and there was no need to help anyone understand Scrum theory and practice.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I worked on the user stories 15-adding-users and 23-show-users.

# Individual Reflections Week 14 - Pawel

* What do I want to learn or understand better?

I do not fully understand how the backend works or how the frontend communicates with the backend. This is why I want to learn more about ASP.NET Core and the backend side of web development. I plan to do this by following a tutorial and creating a web API with ASP.NET controllers.

* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I can possibly help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new by learning more about the technologies that are used in the project, sharing resources that I find useful and participating in discussions.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I participated in the Sprint Planning where we defined a Sprint Goal, wrote user stories, moved them to the Sprint Backlog and estimated how long time each will take. Throughout the week I have written messages about what I have done and what I plan to do next, which is our way of organizing Daily Scrums.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I worked on the user stories 9-design-website-layout and 29-add-admin-page.

* What do I want to learn or understand better?
  * Last week I participated in quite a bit of pair-programming in order to better understand the entirety of our program. 
It was very successful and I've learned alot. This week, the mission is the same. I really hope to get a better overall
understanding so I can manage the program and be able to make changes even after the project is finished. I will act the
same way as last week because i found that to be a very insightful. 
* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  * This week I will strive to do more reviews. This is mainly because i realized that my limited programming skills made it possible
   for me to come with insights that the can benefit the other team-members. 
* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  * I have continued to give suggestions on our upcoming user stories in order to minimize the time we have to spend specifying
  those together with the whole team. I have also been more active in prioritizing the backlog so that we have a good idea
  of what stories to prioritize.
* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  * I was part of the completion of some story points while also attending to all our meetings. I have also spoken with the stake-
holder and booked in our delivery meeting where more a few senior managers will be present.

* What do I want to learn or understand better?
  * I have noticed that many of my team-members use the concept test-driven development when they are developing new code. This is something that I would like to better understand and be able to implement in my own coding. In order to achieve that I will keep it in mind for my future programming sessions and try to working according to the concept.
* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
   * I have noticed that the two best ways to help others learn something new is to do pair-programming as well as having a review system where multiple team-members have to look at other team-members code. These are the two things I would take with me to a future project to help maximize the amount of learning taking place. 
* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  * To better split up stories and try to make as small of a cake-slice as possible, is something that I have taken extra care for to do the last week. This was a great success because we hade a lot of small stories that all of us could work on, even if we had limited time on our hands. If the slices were bigger (as they used to be), then many people would not even take on the project in the first place because they would think that they didn't have the time to finish them. So to split up stories to the smallest possible fragments, while still delivering value, is soemthing that I would take with me to future projects. 
* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  * I have done a lot of stories and also frequently reviewed other team-members PR's. Furthermore, I also booked a delivery meeting with several personel from our Stakeholders side as well as preparing our website with all the information that was needed for a professional delivery.

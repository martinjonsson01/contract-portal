* What do I want to learn or understand better?
  * This week I want to get a better understanding of how passwords can be stored. 
  We discussed hashing and salting the passwords but the latter concept is not something that I am familiar with. 
  For that reason I undertook the user-story where salting and hashing should take place, in order to learn more about the concept. 
* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
   * By learning more about salting myself, I hope to be able to share the new found knowledge with the rest of my team members. 
   I also contributed in pair-programming during the week where I could engage in discussions regarding specific implementations. 
   Hopefully, my pair-programming buddy could learn something from me, as I have myself learnt a lot from him.
* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  * Last week our monday meeting which consists of sprint retrospective, review and planning took super long. 
  In order to shorten the meeting duration and to better adhere to the specifications in the scrum-guide regarding meeting time, 
  me and the current scrum-master specified some user stories in advance for the next meeting. This can hopefully contribute to us 
  having to put less time for that process, and can therefore better follow the recommended time-frames suggested in the Scrum guide. 
* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  * I worked in a pair to complete a large user story while also trying to review some of the pullrequests that came up. 
  I only contributed to one large story so this week I hope to be able to work on more stories.

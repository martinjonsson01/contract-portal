* What do I want to learn or understand better?
  * Last week I got a much better understanding of how passwords can be encrypted with the help of hashing and salting. This week I want to get a better understanding of the different components in our code work together to achieve their purposes. To do this, I will partake in as many pair-programming sessions as possible to leverage the great skills that many of my team-mates have. 
* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
   * As mentioned in many other review, I will strive to be present on all our common sessions where the entire group is present in order to challenge the thoughts and arguments of others. Further, I hope that by engaging in pair-programming there can be a mutual learning. This was something that I noticed during last week, where my totally different perspective of things helped us to overcome bugs that we encountered during a pair-programming session. 
* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  * My contribution was that me and the Scrum master sat down together and prioritized the product backlog, aswell as gave suggestions for how some stories could be specified. This resulted in a much less time being spent on our monday meeting consisting of sprint retrospective as well as review and  planning. By doing this for the remainder of the weeks, I hope to contribute to better follow the specified time-frames for activities suggested by Scrum.
* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  * I managed to deliver some storypoints myself, aswell as helping my team-mates to complete their stories. Another contributing factor was the time that I spent together with the Scrum master to give suggestion for upcoming stories. That saved a lot of hours that could be spent on other tasks for the rest of the group.

# self-reflection-lv2

* What do I want to learn or understand better?
  *  I want to better understand how different programming languages can be used to develop web-applications. 
  That includes learning more about Blazor, C# and ORM. 
  
* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  * By doing research and reading the documents agreed upon by the team, 
  I can perhaps understand something that my teammates find hard or miss. 
  By then attending our weekly meetings, I can share the knowledge with the rest of the group.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  * I have been acting acording to my role as Product Owner. 
  This means for example setting up a meeting with the stakeholder to discuss how we can maximize the value generated throughtout the project. 
* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  * I have been present on all our meetings this week where we discussed 
  things like the scope for the project. Furthermore, I participated on a "lesson" held by Martin on Git Workflow in order 
  to better be able to follow the conventions set up by the group. I have also been having an active conversation with the stakeholders.

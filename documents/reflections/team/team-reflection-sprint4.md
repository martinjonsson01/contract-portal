# Team Reflection Sprint 3
* Närvarande: Ella, Emil, Tamás, Mathias, Pawel, Martin, Jacob, Jonathan
## Customer Value and Scope

your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation and how this influenced the way you worked and created value
 
### User stories
We had a situation where we had a big story, with a dependency on a story that was not completed until the end of the sprint. This resulted in too little time for that story which ultimately resulted in a higher chance of not finishing the story. In the future we want to think more during the sprint planning and assigning of team-members to stories, so that these stories that are depended on are completed earlier in the sprint. 
Another thing we noticed was that our estimated points did not take into account the change in DoD regarding style. This resulted in an under-estimation of some stories which we will try to avoid for this upcoming sprint, by taking the extra work into account.
 
## Application of Scrum
We have noticed that our meetings are taking a lot of time. One week we did the meeting online resulting in a much more efficient meeting where we were done by lunch. Much time has been spent discussing the story details in the process of estimating how many points each story should have. 
In order to be more efficient we will let the product owner be responsible to come up with suggestions of what each story can be about. We will still discuss each story during the meeting to give everyone the possibility to give input. In order to reduce the time spent estimating story points, we will allow blank voting on our planning-poker but at least half the team has to vote. The latter is to avoid the risk of having only a few team-members deciding everything.
We have realized that it is difficult and time consuming to choose a narrow sprint theme while also delivering the most valuable user stories for our stakeholder. This is a dilemma because the things that deliver the most value do not necessarily have to be within one single theme. We also have difficulties with finding user stories within the same theme without dependencies. In order to cope with the dilemma, we have so far set quite broad themes that can include many aspects.
